/**
 * gameloop.cpp — PC game loop implementation for the SSB64 port.
 *
 * This file implements the frame loop that drives SSB64's game logic on PC.
 * The N64 game uses 5 OS threads communicating via message queues. On PC,
 * we run the entire game in a single coroutine that yields at blocking
 * points (osRecvMesg with OS_MESG_BLOCK).
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   main() loop
 *     -> PortPushFrame()
 *       -> post INTR_VRETRACE to scheduler queue
 *       -> resume game coroutine
 *         -> scheduler coroutine processes tick (sends to clients)
 *         -> game logic runs one frame
 *         -> display list built, submitted to scheduler
 *         -> scheduler calls osSpTaskStartGo -> port_submit_display_list
 *         -> Fast3D renders via DrawAndRunGraphicsCommands
 *         -> game coroutine yields at next osRecvMesg(BLOCK) on empty queue
